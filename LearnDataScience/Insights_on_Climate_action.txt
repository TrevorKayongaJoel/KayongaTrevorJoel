Findings:

Key variables influencing fertilizer recommendations: soil_pH, soil_moisture, temperature.

Highest average soil moisture crop: Wheat.

Crops with temperatures > 30Â°C and low moisture need increased irrigation.

Recommendations:

Automate fertilizer dosing via AI models trained on cleaned data.

Adjust irrigation schedules for heat-sensitive crops with low moisture retention.

Optimize fertilizer use based on soil moisture and temperature.

Monitor pH levels for crops sensitive to acidity
